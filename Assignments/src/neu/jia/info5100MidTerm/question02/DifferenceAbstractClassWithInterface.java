    //Answer for the question 2 : the differences between abstract class and interface

    //Abstract class

    //1.a class can only extents one abstract class
    //2.abstract class can have fields
    //3.abstract class can have access modifiers
    //4.have abstract methods and concrete method
    //5.as for speed: abstract class is fast
    //6.an abstract class can be extended
    //7.an abstract class can have public and protected method
    //8.abstract class can inheritance interfaces and class
    //9.abstract method is a must


    //Interface:

    //1.a class can implements multiple interfaces
    //2.interface do not have fields and could only have methods that need to be override
    //3.interface do not have access modifiers
    //4.have abstract methods only
    //5.as for speed: interface is slow
    //6.interface cannot be extended, can only be implements
    //7.interface can only have public methods
    //8.interface can inherit interface but not class
    //9.abstract method is not necessary
